# Did any byte of the assembly move?
#
# Every other suite here asks whether the compiler is *right*. This one asks a
# narrower question that the others cannot: whether it produces exactly what it
# produced before. That is the question a refactor has to answer, and answering
# it by running the differential suites is not enough - they compare cc1
# against gcc on what a program prints, so a change that reorders two
# independent instructions, or renames a label, or drops a directive the
# assembler did not need, passes all of them while the output is not the same
# text at all.
#
# It exists because it earned itself twice in one day. Cutting the emission
# seam into the x86-64 generator touched 417 sites; the corpus stayed green
# throughout, and this is what proved the 1,648 files were byte-identical
# rather than merely still correct. Then, converting the MASM spelling to
# append to a string, 'o_ += frameSize' compiled cleanly and appended a
# *character* - an int converted to char - to 313 files. Every suite still
# passed. This named the 313.
#
# What it certifies is stability, not correctness: a wrong instruction that
# does not move is a wrong instruction this suite is happy with, and for a
# while every digest here notarised a negation that lost the sign of zero.
# The differential suites are the ones that ask whether the bytes are right;
# this one asks only whether they are the same bytes as yesterday.
#
#   ./tests/fingerprint.sh            compare against tests/fingerprint.txt
#   ./tests/fingerprint.sh --record   write tests/fingerprint.txt
#
# Run it before a refactor and after. A difference is not automatically a
# fault: when the output is *meant* to move, --record and let the diff of
# fingerprint.txt be reviewed like any other change. That is the point of
# keeping it in the repository rather than in a scratch directory - the file
# is a record of what the compiler emitted, and git already knows how to show
# what changed about it.
#
# **No assembler and no linker.** This is 'cc1 -S' and nothing else, so it runs
# wherever cc1 builds - the Mac, the Linux box, a Windows host - and it covers
# all four spellings from any one of them, including targets that machine
# cannot execute. The fingerprint is the same on every host, which is checked:
# nothing in the output depends on the machine it was produced on, or on the
# path the compiler was invoked with.
