"""Write the load suite into tests/load/.

The cases in tests/cases are small on purpose: each one asks whether a rule
of the language is obeyed. These ask a different question - whether the
compiler still obeys them when the program is large - and the answers are
not the same. Two defects were found by the first version of this file and
neither could have been reached by a small program:

  * an arm64 frame past 4095 bytes, because 'sub sp, sp, #n' takes twelve
    bits and the assembler refuses the rest;
  * a call with more arguments than the registers can carry, which read past
    the end of the register table and gave a five-argument function %xmm0
    for its fifth argument on Windows.

Every program here prints something a person could check by hand, and the
suite compares it against the app's interpreter like any other case. Sizes
are chosen so the interpreter can run each in well under a second: this is a
test of the compiler at scale, not a benchmark of the oracle.

Deterministic - regenerating produces byte-identical files, so the committed
programs can be diffed after a change to this script.
