# Finding the rest of the program in the other files beside it.

# Shalimar has no include and no import: a call to a function this file does
# not define is looked for in the project's other files, and what is found is
# compiled in. There is nothing here to declare and nothing to keep up to
# date, and a program becomes a library by renaming its main().
#
# These cases live apart from tests/cases because they are about several files
# at once, which the recorder and the two remote suites both assume there are
# not. The app's interpreter cannot run them at all - it has one file and no
# project - which is the cost written down in docs/CROSSFILE.md.
