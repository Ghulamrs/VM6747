// assert.h - the diagnostic that a condition held.
//
// The one header in the standard that is *required* to be re-readable: NDEBUG
// is consulted at every #include, not once, so a file may include this twice
// with the macro defined in between and get both behaviours. That is why the
// include guard here covers only the declarations and not the macro, which is
// undefined and redefined on every pass. Guarding the whole file, as every
// other header here does, would be the ordinary thing to do and would be
// wrong.
//
// Each platform reports a failed assertion through its own function, with the
// arguments in its own order:
//
//     glibc   __assert_fail(expr, file, line, function)
//     macOS   __assert_rtn(function, file, line, expr)
//     UCRT    _assert(expr, file, line)
//
// None returns. Calling abort() instead would be simpler and would lose the
// message, which is the only part of an assertion anybody reads.
//
// __func__ is C99 and this compiler does not have it, so the function name is
// given as a literal rather than left out - the platforms that want the
// argument want something there.
