// math.h - the C90 mathematical functions.
//
// The same bargain as <stdio.h>: prototypes only, and the real implementations
// arrive from the host's libm at link time. The suite builds every case twice,
// once with cc1 and once with the reference compiler, so a prototype that
// disagreed with the platform's would be caught by the answer coming out wrong
// rather than by anything here.
//
// Everything in C90's <math.h> is 'double' in and 'double' out. There are no
// float or long double variants - 'sqrtf' and 'sqrtl' are C99, and 'long
// double' is not a type this compiler has - so a program wanting a float result
// converts one, which is what C90 programs did.
//
// The three that are not simply 'double f(double)' are the ones that return a
// second answer through a pointer: frexp splits a number into a fraction and an
// exponent, modf into a fractional and an integral part, and ldexp puts a
// frexp'd pair back together.

// C90 requires HUGE_VAL to be a positive double, and permits it to be infinite.

// The M_ constants are **not in C90**, and are here on purpose.
//
// They are POSIX rather than ISO, and every implementation ships them - glibc
// unless __STRICT_ANSI__, macOS outright, MSVC behind _USE_MATH_DEFINES. A
// program that computes an angle writes M_PI and does not think of itself as
// reaching for an extension, so leaving them out means the first real
// trigonometric program written against this compiler does not build. That is
// a worse answer than being one macro wider than the standard.
//
// Written to more digits than a double can hold, so the value rounds to the
// nearest representable one rather than to whatever a shorter literal reaches.
