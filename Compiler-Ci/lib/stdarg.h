/* Three targets, two va_lists, and the split is not where you would guess.
 *
 * va_list is the ABI's choice and not this compiler's: vprintf lives in the C
 * library and reads whatever the platform says a va_list is, so what is below
 * has to match it byte for byte or the first forwarded call walks the wrong
 * memory.
 *
 * System V is the odd one. It passes variadic arguments in registers like any
 * other, so the callee spills them to a save area and the va_list has to
 * describe two of those - a four-field record holding an offset into each
 * register file and two pointers. It is declared as an array of one so that
 * passing it decays to a pointer and the callee's walk is visible to the
 * caller, which is what the standard requires of va_list without saying how.
 *
 * Microsoft x64 and Apple's arm64 both make it a plain char *, and for
 * different reasons that arrive at the same shape. Windows gives every
 * argument, named or not, a consecutive eight-byte slot starting at the shadow
 * space the caller already left, and sends a variadic float in the integer
 * register as well as the vector one - so eight bytes read the right thing
 * whatever the type. Apple simply departs from AAPCS64 and puts the whole
 * variadic part on the stack in eight-byte slots, never in registers. Two
 * different rules, one pointer walk.
 *
 * __builtin_va_start takes a pointer to the va_list object in every case.
 * System V gets one for free, an array of one decaying; the other two have to
 * take the address, which is the only reason the macros differ in shape.

/* The C6000 is a fourth target and the third char *: TI's convention puts the
 * last named argument and everything after it on the stack, a word each and
 * an 8-byte value at an 8-byte boundary, so one pointer walks them. */
