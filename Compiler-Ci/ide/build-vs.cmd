REM Build cc1.sln with MSBuild, from a plain shell.
REM
REM **Run it by its full path and with no `cmd /c` in front.** The ssh shell on
REM the Windows box is already cmd; a prefix nests one inside the other, strips
REM the outer quotes and leaks one into %1. The same note is on msvc\build.cmd,
REM and it is here because a chain of quoted paths typed at ssh fails the same
REM way - which is what this file exists to stop anybody rediscovering.
