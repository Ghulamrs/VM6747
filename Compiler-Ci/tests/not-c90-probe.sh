# What C90 forbids, and what this compiler does about it.
#
# The other half of tests/c90-probe.sh, and it exists because that one cannot
# see this. Every file in tests/c90/ is valid C90 that cc1 refuses, so the probe
# built on it can only ever find features that are missing. A feature that is
# *extra* - something C90 forbids and cc1 takes anyway - leaves no trace there,
# and none in tests/run.sh either, where a case is written only once it passes.
# Both suites are silent about the same thing, which is how five extensions came
# to be in this compiler with two of them written down.
#
# So: each file here is a program C90 does not allow. "accepts" means cc1 takes
# it, which is a divergence from the language it claims and belongs in
# docs/STATUS.md by name. "refuses" means the check exists. An entry flips to
# "refuses" the day one is added, the same way an entry in the other corpus
# flips to "accepts" the day a feature lands.
#
# An extension is not automatically a fault. Variadic macros are here and are
# kept deliberately, because the alternative in real code is no macro at all.
# What is a fault is an extension nobody wrote down - a program that compiles
# here and not with the compiler this one is measured against, for a reason
# neither the docs nor the suite can name.
#
# It exits 0 whatever it finds, like its counterpart.
#
#   ./tests/not-c90-probe.sh

# Needs gcc for the second opinion; without it the verdict column reads "?".
