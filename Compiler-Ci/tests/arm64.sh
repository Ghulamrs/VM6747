# The arm64-darwin backend, run the same way the x86-64 one is: compile each
# case twice, once with cc1 and once with the reference compiler, run both, and
# require that they agree on the printed output and the exit status.
#
# This runs on the Mac rather than the box, because the Mac is arm64 and can
# execute what this backend emits. clang is the reference here, where gcc is the
# reference on Linux - a different compiler, but the same argument: it is the
# implementation sitting on the same disk, and where the two disagree the case
# is wrong until the standard says otherwise.
#
# It is a subset. The backend still refuses structs, member access, calls
# through a function pointer and va_start by name, so tests/cases is not the
# corpus here - tests/arm64/ is, and it grows as the backend does. Floating
# point, postfix and switch have since landed and have cases below.
