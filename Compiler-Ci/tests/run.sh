# Differential regression suite.
#
# Every case is compiled twice - once by cc1, once by gcc - both binaries are
# run, and a case passes only when the two agree on the exit status AND on what
# they printed, and both match the expected exit code on the first line.
#
# Comparing against gcc rather than against expectations alone is the point.
# An expectation is my opinion about C; gcc is the reference implementation
# sitting on the same disk. Where the two disagree the case is wrong until
# proven otherwise. That has already caught four wrong expectations of mine -
# each reported as "both gave X", which is the suite saying the compilers agree
# and the arithmetic in the case does not.
#
# Every binary runs under a timeout. Once a language has loops, a codegen bug
# stops giving wrong answers and starts giving none: breaking the remainder
# fixup turned collatz.c into an infinite loop and hung the suite until it was
# killed by hand.
#
# Cases run in parallel, because they are independent and because the work is
# not this compiler. Measured over 191 cases: cc1 accounts for 0.3s of about
# 12s, and the rest is gcc assembling, gcc building the reference, and running
# two binaries per case. Output is collected per case and printed in name order
# afterwards, so a parallel run reads exactly like a serial one - a test suite
# whose output shuffles between runs is a test suite nobody trusts.
#
#   ./tests/run.sh              all cases
#   ./tests/run.sh gcd          cases whose name contains "gcd"
#   ./tests/run.sh '' 1         serially, which is what to use when debugging
#
# Exits non-zero if any case fails.
