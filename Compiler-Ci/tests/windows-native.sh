# The x86_64-windows backend, on Windows.
#
# tests/windows.sh runs the same corpus on Linux, and explains at length why
# that is sound. It is sound, and it is not the same thing as this. That suite
# proves the backend is self-consistent; this one proves it agrees with
# Microsoft.
#
# Keep both, and not out of caution. This suite is the weaker of the two on at
# least one rule, which was measured rather than assumed: setting the scratch
# register back to %rdi - the register Microsoft x64 makes the callee's to give
# back, and the whole reason the generator uses %r10 here - leaves all nine
# cases passing on real Windows. The C runtime happens to keep nothing in %rdi
# across its call to main, so nothing notices. The "// forbid:" line in
# w_callee_saved.c catches it every time, by reading the assembly, on Linux.
# A binary that runs is evidence, not proof.
#
# It runs from the Mac, for the same reason tests/arm64.sh does - the Mac is
# the machine that can reach what is needed. Here that is a Windows host over
# ssh, named "windows" in ~/.ssh/config. The Linux box cannot reach it; the box
# is in AWS and the Windows machine is on the LAN.
#
# The division of labour:
#
#   here      cc1 -arch x86_64-windows, one .s per case
#   there     clang assembles the AT&T syntax and links it as a PE binary,
#             against the real C runtime, and runs it
#
# clang rather than MSVC, and this is not a preference. cl compiles C and ml64
# assembles MASM; neither reads the GNU syntax cc1 writes. clang's integrated
# assembler does, targets x86_64-pc-windows-msvc, and links through the MSVC
# toolchain that is already on that machine.
#
# One transfer quirk, and it cost a confusing half hour. The Mac's filesystem
# is case-insensitive, so a harness named msabi_slots.S and the generated
# msabi_slots.s are the same file here and one silently replaces the other.
# The harnesses are relayed as .harness.asm for that reason alone.
#
#   ./tests/windows-native.sh
#
# Exits non-zero if any case fails, or if the Windows host cannot be reached.
