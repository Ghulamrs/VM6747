# What C90 says, and what this compiler does about it.
#
# Not a test suite, and the difference matters. tests/run.sh holds cases the
# compiler must pass and fails the build when one breaks; every case in it was
# written because the feature already worked. That makes it a good ratchet and
# a poor explorer - it can only ever report on ground already taken.
#
# This asks the other question. Each file in tests/c90/ is one C90 feature that
# cc1 did not accept when the corpus was written, so a fresh run reads as all
# REFUSES and that is correct rather than alarming - the features that work are
# in tests/cases, where 396 of them are checked against gcc on every build.
# What this is, is the gap list with its own proof attached: an entry flips to
# "accepts" the day it is implemented, and nothing has to be remembered.
#
# gcc -std=c90 -pedantic is consulted on the same file, so a refusal separates
# into "cc1 is behind the standard" and "the case is wrong" without argument.
#
# It exits 0 whatever it finds. A feature that is missing is a fact about
# today, not a failure - the point is to be able to re-derive the list in
# docs/STATUS.md rather than to trust that it is still true. That list was two
# entries long and wrong until this was run for the first time, which is the
# whole argument for having it.
#
#   ./tests/c90-probe.sh
#
# Needs gcc for the second opinion; without it the verdict column reads "?" and
# the rest still works.
