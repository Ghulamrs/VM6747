# The x86_64-windows backend, checked on Linux.
#
# This needs saying, because it looks wrong. There is no Windows machine here
# and no mingw, wine or clang on this box - and yet these binaries run, and the
# convention they follow really is Microsoft's rather than System V's.
#
# What makes it work is that a Windows-convention program with no library calls
# is a self-contained blob that Linux is happy to execute. The only boundary is
# main itself: it takes no arguments, and both conventions return int in %eax,
# so glibc calling it cannot tell the difference. Everything inside - which
# register holds argument three, where the fifth one sits, who opens the shadow
# space - is between functions cc1 emitted, and they agree with each other.
#
# One further thing has to hold, and it is a real property of the backend rather
# than a convenience: Microsoft x64 makes %rdi and %rsi the callee's to preserve
# where System V makes them scratch. The generator therefore uses %r10 as its
# scratch on this target, so a cc1 function clobbers neither, and glibc gets
# back what it lent. Break that and this suite keeps passing while real Windows
# code corrupts its caller - which is why w_callee_saved.c greps the assembly.
#
# Two kinds of case live here.
#
#   Ordinary ones are differential in the usual way: compiled by cc1 for
#   x86_64-windows, compiled again by gcc for Linux, both run, both compared.
#   That works because the two ABIs compute the same answers - they disagree
#   about where arguments travel, not about what addition is.
#
#   A case marked "// windows-only:" is compiled and checked but not run,
#   because it calls the C library and so crosses the very boundary this suite
#   depends on nothing crossing. tests/windows-native.sh runs it for real.
#
#   A case marked "// no-reference:" skips gcc. LLP64 is the reason: long is 4
#   bytes on this target and 8 to the gcc on this box, so for anything that
#   measures a long the reference is not a second opinion but a different
#   question. Those cases are held to their // expect: line alone, and the
#   marker has to say why.
#
# And one case is neither. msabi_slots.S is a caller written by hand from the
# Microsoft convention - it loads %rcx, %xmm1, %r8, %xmm3 for arguments one to
# four and opens 32 bytes of shadow - and it calls a function cc1 compiled. Both
# suites above would pass a convention that was wrong in the same way at both
# ends, because cc1 is on both ends. This one would not: the caller is an
# independent reading of the spec, and if cc1 puts argument three anywhere but
# %r8 the answer comes out wrong. Any case with a .S beside it is linked
# against it and gets no gcc reference.
#
#   ./tests/windows.sh
#
# Exits non-zero if any case fails.
