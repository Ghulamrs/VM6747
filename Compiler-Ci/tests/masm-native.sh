# The x86_64-windows backend on Windows, through Microsoft's own toolchain.
#
# tests/windows-native.sh runs the same corpus there through clang, which reads
# the GNU syntax cc1 used to write for every target. This one runs it the way
# the platform does: cc1 emits MASM, ml64 assembles it, link.exe links it
# against the static CRT, and the result is a PE binary with nothing in its
# path borrowed from another toolchain.
#
# Keep both, and not out of caution. They answer different questions. That one
# asks whether the *instruction selection* is right, on an assembler that reads
# the same syntax the Linux suite checks. This one asks whether the *spelling*
# is right - whether the translation in src/backend/Masm.cpp says to ml64 what
# the generator meant - and a wrong answer here is a wrong answer nowhere else,
# because no other assembler ever sees this text.
#
# It runs from the Mac, for the same reason tests/arm64.sh does: the Mac is the
# machine that can reach the Windows host over ssh, named "windows" in
# ~/.ssh/config. The Linux box cannot - it is in AWS and the Windows machine is
# on the LAN.
#
#   here      cc1 -arch x86_64-windows, one .asm per case, MASM by default
#   there     ml64 assembles, link.exe links against libcmt and the UCRT,
#             and the program runs
#
# Exits non-zero if any case fails, or if the Windows host cannot be reached.
