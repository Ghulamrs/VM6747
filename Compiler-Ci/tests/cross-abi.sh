# cc1's objects linked against the host compiler's, both directions.
#
# This exists because of a bug the rest of the suite could not see. A struct of
# four bytes was returned in %rdx where the ABI says %rax - and cc1's caller
# read %rdx too, so cc1 agreed with itself perfectly. tests/run.sh compiles a
# case twice and compares what the two programs print; two separately built,
# internally consistent programs print the same thing, and the disagreement
# never surfaces. It took building for a target whose other half was right for
# the two to fall out of step.
#
# So the question here is not "does cc1 produce the right answer" but "does
# cc1 produce the answer the *other* compiler expects". That can only be asked
# by making one of them the caller and the other the callee, and it is the only
# check in this repository that links objects from two different compilers into
# one program.
#
# Each case below is a pair: an interface, a callee compiled by one compiler,
# and a caller compiled by the other. Both directions are run, because getting
# them wrong in the same way is exactly the failure this is here to catch.
#
