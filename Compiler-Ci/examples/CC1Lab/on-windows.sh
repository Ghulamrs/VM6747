# Build and run CC1Lab for x86_64-windows, on Windows.
#
# The Xcode project builds this lab for arm64-darwin with cc1 behind the shim.
# This is the other half: the same three files compiled for the other target,
# assembled by ml64 and linked by link.exe against the real UCRT, and run on a
# Windows machine over ssh.
#
# Nothing in the lab is written twice for it. <setjmp.h> is what differs
# between the two - the UCRT's setjmp takes a hidden frame argument and wants a
# sixteen-byte aligned jmp_buf, where the Unixes want neither - and all of that
# is inside the shipped header and the compiler. The source is the source.
#
# The rule that governs the shape of this script: cc1 has no assembler and no
# linker of its own, and nothing on a Mac can assemble MASM. So the work splits
# in two - the compile happens here, and the assemble, link and run happen
# there, which is why the assembly is relayed rather than the program.
#
#   ./examples/CC1Lab/on-windows.sh
#   WINDOWS_HOST=other ./examples/CC1Lab/on-windows.sh
#
# The host needs an entry in ~/.ssh/config with a key that has no passphrase,
# and Visual Studio installed - vswhere is what finds it. See
# tests/masm-native.sh, which does the same thing for the Windows corpus.
