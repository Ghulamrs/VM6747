// limits.h - the ranges of the integer types, as this target has them.
//
// Every value here is a property of the target rather than of the standard,
// and the compiler already knows all of them: it predefines __SIZEOF_INT__ and
// the rest before reading a line. What it cannot do is hand them over as
// limits, because C has no way to write "the largest value of a type" as an
// expression - so they are spelled out, and the one that actually varies is
// guarded.
//
// LONG is the only width that moves between the three targets. Linux and macOS
// are LP64, where long is eight bytes; Windows is LLP64, where it is four and
// only long long is eight. That single difference is why this file has an
// #ifdef in it and <float.h> does not.
//
// The negative minima are written as (-MAX - 1) rather than as the literal.
// -2147483648 is not an int constant in C: it is the unary minus of
// 2147483648, which does not fit in an int, so writing it directly gives the
// value the wrong type. This spelling is the standard's own.
