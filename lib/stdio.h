// __attribute__, 15 of long double and a scattering of __extension__, __asm__,
// __inline and __typeof - none of it C, and all of it in the way before a
// single usable declaration. What a program wants from stdio.h is the
// prototypes, and a prototype is ordinary C.
//
// These declarations must agree with glibc's, because the program links against
// glibc. Nothing here is taken on trust: every test case is built a second time
// by gcc, which reads the real header, and the two binaries must produce the
// same bytes and the same exit status. A prototype that lied would fail there -
// which is why the suite deliberately does not pass -I to gcc.
