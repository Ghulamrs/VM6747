# The Windows leg: relay the emulator's sources to the Windows box, build
# them there with cl (msvc/build.cmd), run every .s the two compilers' suites
# left in their tests/out-tms6747 directories on that binary, and require
# the same output and exit status as this machine's binary gives for the
# same assembly. The .s files are the Mac's, so what this checks is the
# emulator's portability, not the compilers'; the compilers' own Windows
# legs are their business.
#
# The box is `ssh windows` (see the windows-test-machine note); its shell
# is cmd, so build.cmd is run by its full path with no "cmd /c" in front,
# and the loop over the cases runs in Git bash there. MSVC writes CRLF on
# stdout, so the Windows output is normalised before the comparison.
