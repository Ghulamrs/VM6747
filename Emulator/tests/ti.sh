# The fourth sandbox: TI's own C6000 tools on the Windows box, as a second
# oracle beside the emulator. Every .s the three compilers' tms6747 suites
# left behind - c90's, cpp11's, shalimar's programs and the Shalimar runtime
# cpp11 built - is shipped there, assembled by cl6x and linked by lnk6x
# against rts6740_elf_eh.lib. The emulator says whether a program computes
# the right answer; this says whether TI's assembler takes every instruction,
# constant and directive as written and whether every name the backend uses
# is one TI's runtime defines. It cannot run anything: CCS7 has no simulator.
#
# What must be on the box: the compiler at C:\ti\ccsv7\tools\compiler\
# ti-cgt-c6000_8.2.2 (found there 2026-09-14), and the exception-handling
# build of its runtime at C:\Users\GRA\Documents\VM6747\tilib, made once by
#   mklib --pattern=rts6740_elf_eh.lib --index=libc.a --parallel=4
#         --install_to=C:\Users\GRA\Documents\VM6747\tilib
# from the lib directory, with C:\ti\ccsv7\utils\bin (gmake) on the PATH.
# The shipped rts6740_elf.lib is the no-exceptions build: every C++ program
# that throws, and every one that reaches operator new, needs the other.
#
# tests/ti-nolink.txt names the programs that assemble but do not link, and
# why; anything else that fails to assemble or link fails this suite.
